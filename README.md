# Vue.JS + Rails 5.1 Word Checker

This is an example of integrating Vue with Rails 5.1+ and the webpacker gem.

Data is collected dynamically from an API based on the user input, everytime he presses a key which in effect updates the components.

The API `https://wagon-dictionary.herokuapp.com/` indicates if the given word is a valid english word (validator) or indicates the words which use the given word as a stem (autocomplete).

Vue features used: single file components, interpolations, directives, conditional rendering, list rendering, event handeling, form input bindings.
